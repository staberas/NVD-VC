how it works

 video from sites that can be downloaded but in the inspector you have a 3-8 second ts video file 

for example:  https://cdntest.live/file/hls/62cf325075425b99bb694cb8/001.ts when you move in the player it will download the corresponded video in that timecode inspector https://cdntest.live/file/hls/62cf325075425b99bb694cb8/022.ts etc

The python will download all the files and merge them in one video file
copy the url for example: https://cdntest.live/file/hls/62cf325075425b99bb694cb8/001.ts
and paste in the python 

Enter the base URL: https://cdntest.live/file/hls/62cf325075425b99bb694cb8/
Enter the filename of the first file in the sequence: 000.ts
Enter the filename of the last file in the sequence: 216.ts
